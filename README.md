## Some ideas
<li>Use scrapydweb or spider-admin-pro to manage various kinds of spiders(crawlers).
<li>And backend provides general processing to the result of spiders. However, for some special sites like weibo, we can provide more features.<br>It means that our frontend must use components. Once we want to support a new website like www.jd.com, we just need to code a new crawler. And use general backend services.
